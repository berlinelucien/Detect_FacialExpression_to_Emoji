# Detect_FacialExpression_to_Emoji

Built a Python Application that can turn face expressions into emojis. 
I trained a Machine Learning Model with TensorFlow to detect face expressions like happy, 
sad, fearful and so on. Then I mapped those expressions to Emojis in real time.
The frontend uses TkInter and the entire functionality of the application.
